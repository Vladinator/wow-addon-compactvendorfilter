## Title: CompactVendorFilter is now part of CompactVendor (It's safe to delete me!)
## Notes: Compact Vendor Filter adds a easy to use menu to filter items from vendors. Inspiration drawn from Yssaril's GoblinVendorFilter. Note that since Dragonflight this module has been baked into the main addon and is now safe to be deleted.
